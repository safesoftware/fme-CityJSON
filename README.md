# CityJSON Format Plugin for FME

This repository contains the source code of the CityJSON Format Plugin for FME, which allows us to read CityJSON files, and to write to CityJSON files.

## Description

[CityJSON](https://www.cityjson.org) is a format for encoding a subset of the CityGML data model (version 2.0.0) using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). 
A CityJSON file represents both the geometry and the semantics of the city features of a given area, eg buildings, roads, rivers, the vegetation, and the city furniture.

[FME](https://www.safe.com) is the all-in-one tool for data integration and productivity.

## Requirements
FME 2018.0 or later installed on either
* Linux
* Mac
* Windows

## Limitations
We are working toward full CityJSON support. 
We have tested the reader on the file in the [example data directory](https://github.com/safesoftware/fme-CityJSON/tree/master/example_data), and some more.

### Reader limitations

  - MultiGeometries are not supported yet
  - Appearances (textures, materials) are not supported yet
  - SemanticSurface hierarchies (children, parent) are not supported yet
  - Extenstions are not supported yet

\**not supported* means in this case that the property is ignored when reading the file, but doesn't break the process.

### Writer limitations

  - Appearances (textures, materials) are not supported yet
  - SemanticSurfaces are not written yet
  - GeometryTemplates are not written yet


## How to build

### Linux and macOS

**With SCons:**

1. Install scons (package manager on Linux, python pip on macOS)
2. Edit fmecityjson/SConstruct to point at FME install folder and nlohmann's json project
3. From within fmecityjson, run `scons`

**With CMake:**

Do the usual CMake build setup in the source dir.
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DFME_DEV_HOME=/path/to/fme/installation/dir ../
make && make install
```
The option `-DFME_DEV_HOME` is required for both linking the FME libraries and installing the plugin. See the *Installation Instructions* below for the details, and the `CMakeLists.txt`.

Under macOS, the .app are usually installed under `/Applications/` but you need to specify the folder where everything is installed, by default `/Library/FME/2019.1/` it seems (or later version).

### Windows
Set an environment variable FME_DEV_HOME to be the path to the directory where FME is installed.  For example, C:\Program Files\FME
In Visual Studio (2017 or later), open `fmecityjson.sln`.
Select either the `x64` or `x86` configuration, depending on if you want to build 64-bit or 32-bit versions, respectively.  Your choice of 64-bit or 32-bit must match the version of FME you are running.
The solution contains a Debug and Release
configuration. When a project is built in the Debug
configuration, debug information can be retrieved when
running project.
Build the plug-ins by selecting Build > Build
Solution from the menu.
To verify the build was successful, select View > Error List
from the menu. In the Error List pane, check that there
are 0 errors.

## Installation Instructions
The latest beta versions of FME now already ship with this included.  (FME 2020.0 and later) No work is needed.
If you wish to update FME yourself, there are several steps necessary to extend FME to include this CityJSON Format support.

* The Plugin:
**Build the CityJSON plugin, using the instructions above.  This will produce a file `cityjson.so` file on Linux and macOS (a `.dylib` will be created under macOS, but the CMake will rename it to a `.so` otherwise FME won't work), or a `cityjson.dll` file on Windows.  Copy this file into the `plugins` subdirectory where FME is installed.
* The Metafile:
** Copy the file `cityjson.fmf` into the `metafile` subdirectory where FME is installed.
(The metafile contains directives that inform FME of the details about a format such as default parameters, settings, schemas and so on.)
* The cityJSON schema files
** visit https://github.com/cityjson/specs and download the "schemas" subdirectory, for the version of the specs you want to use.  Drop those into the FME install directory in this precise location (For the 1.0.1 version, for example):  plugins/cityjson/1.0.1/schemas
* Restart FME

## How to debug
### Linux and macOS
1. Edit fmecityjson/SConscript: add `-g` and `-O0` to CCFLAGS (debug info and disable optimization)
2. From within fmecityjson, run `scons`
3. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/fme-desktop-2019/fmecore`
4. Start debugger against `/opt/fme-desktop-2019/bin/fme` (not the shell script in the install root)
